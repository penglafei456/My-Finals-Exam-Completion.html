                There is something about being a student here that really creates a unique experience like never before, whether it would be good or not, it's still something meant to be cherished

                <p class="para">
                    You know when an opportunity arises to you? Something so unbelievable to you
                    that you start to question its own legitimate? If I stepped back and ran away from it,
                    I wouldn't be holding a plane ticket to Taiwan. Such an experience before was not easy,
                    such as gathering the needed requirements that were proven difficult to attain.
                    But even so, I want to thank the support I've gotten, tho skeptical and worried,
                    my family and friends supported me before I waved my last goodbye till I meet them again.

                <p class="para">
                    The course chosen wasn't exactly the one I wanted
                    to pursue in the future. Although technology is not a foreign concept
                    to me, the studies that involved tech, mainly tackling software
                    features were not something I had prior knowledge of.
                    Not only that but as a foreigner in a country that barely spoke
                    english was a huge struggle to me. Linguistic and Technology Issues aside,
                    living conditions and new environment took me a while to adjust.

                <p class="para">
                    Even in those sleepless nights, tired mornings, and never-ending work and school
                    responsibilities, you can never go wrong with going out for relaxation trips
                    or hanging out with friends. In my free time, I would love to play games, especially
                    with my dear friends from here or back at my home, Philippines. I also travel
                    around Kaoshiung to buy merchandise of my favorite KPOP groups or Anime. These
                    things make the busy life more bareable than anything

                <p class="para">
                    Even in one year, this is just yet the beginning of something
                    much bigger and brighter. Whatever the future brings for me, I will be ready to take
                    flight and fight. I hope that in the near days coming, I do hope that I don't give
                    up on the goal I've scarred on my skin since then.
